<arguments name="Bundle">
  <arg boolean name="iife" short="i">
    Add the IIFE flag to prevent name clashes.
  </arg>
  <arg name="temp" default="depack-temp">
    The path to the temp directory used to transpile JSX files.
  </arg>
  <arg boolean name="preact" short="H">
    Add the `import { h } from "preact"` to JSX files automatically.
    Does not process files found in the `node_modules`, because
    they are not placed in the temp, and must be built separately,
    e.g., with Ã€LaMode transpiler.
  </arg>
  <arg boolean name="external" short="E">
    The `preact` dependency in `node_modules` will be temprorary
    renamed to `_preact`, and a monkey-patching package that
    imports `@externs/preact` will take its place. This is to allow
    bundles to import from _Preact_ installed as a script on a webpage,
    but exclude it from compilation. `preact` will be restored at the end.
